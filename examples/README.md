# Toy Dataset

The folder contains a CSV file that could be used to generate an analysis sequence for exploring and demonstrating Scorecard library functions.

The dataset was generated synthetically and does not derive from analyses of biological specimens. Each column features fabricated Fold Change and p-values corresponding to ten hypothetical bacterial strains cultivated in a laboratory setting and subjected to a specific experimental condition compared to a control or baseline. These ten bacterial cultures can be evaluated against one another. Gene IDs are alphanumeric identifiers created by randomly combining letters and numbers.

The dataset could be interpreted as post-processed RNA-seq data from bacteria cultured on Petri dishes:

| Abbreviations | Bacteria |
|-----:|---------------|
|MRSA| Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus|
|VRE| Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus|
|EHEC| Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli|
|VRSA| Vancomycin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus|
|CRE| Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae|
|MDR_TB | Multidrug-Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis|
|XDR_TB | Extensively Drug-Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis|
|GAS| Group A Streptococcus|
|GBS| Group B Streptococcus|
|NTHi| Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae|
