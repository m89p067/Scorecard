# Folder contents

The folder contains a CSV file that could use to generate an analysis sequence exploiting Scorecard library functions.

The dataset was created artificially and it is not constituted by computations on biological samples.

Each column contains fake (log_2) Fold Change and p-values representing ten experimental conditions, which could be compared to each other

The Scorecard library contains an utility function to generate a list of combinations (without repetitions) for iterating over all samples
