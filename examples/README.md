# Folder contents (toy example)

The folder contains a CSV file that could be used to generate an analysis sequence to explore Scorecard library functions.

The dataset was created artificially, and it is not constituted by computations on biological samples: each column contains fake Fold Change and p-values representing ten experimental conditions, which could be compared to each other. Gene IDs are alphanumeric codes built by randomly mixing numbers and letters.

As a side note, the Scorecard library contains a utility function to generate a list of combinations (without repetitions) for iterating over all samples.
